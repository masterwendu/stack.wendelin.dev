# Cross-Platform applications

Cloud apps or apps I use on more than one platform.

## Bitwarden password manager
*for managing my passwords securely*

[Website](https://bitwarden.com/)

**Why**<br/>
Open source password manager that is easy to use and works on all platforms. I don't have to care about sync and I can share passwords with my family.

**Problems**<br/>
Mobile apps are sometimes a bit slow and don't have perfect loading indicators if they lag.

## Firefox
*for browsing the web*

[Website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Also mentioned in [Linux](../linux#firefox)

**Why**<br/>
Sync history between devices is very easy and helps me to find pages I was recently surfing on.

**Problems**<br/>
- iPadOS: some websites like Github tell me that my browser is out of date, whats strange because under the hood firefox for iOS is just Safari. Then also sometimes payments via Paypal are not working because browser is too old.
- See pages of another device is normaly not up to date, so you cannot use it for link sharing

## Telegram messenger
*for instant messenging*

[Website](https://telegram.org/)

**Why**<br/>
Cloud based, so I can use it on all devices. Very fast clients. Always nice new features.

**Problems**<br/>
- Video chat would be nice
- new function to go to next photo just by pressing on one side of an image is annoying, because I always just hit it by accident.

## Trello
*for task managment private + work*

[Website](https://telegram.org/)

**Why**<br/>
I tried a lot of task apps, but trello is for me the easiest way to sort my brain.
The way of having everything regarding one task within the card with a history of the changes is perfect for the way I work.

**Problems**<br/>
- Data is on Trello server not encrypted

## Nextcloud
*for filestorage*

[Website](https://nextcloud.com/)

**Why**<br/>
A save place for my data and photos. Moreover I got rid of be dependent by google, because I sync my calendar and my contacts via nextcloud.
