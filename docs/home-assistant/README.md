# Home assistant

At home I have a smart home running with home assistant.

I am a big fan of this project and the community behind it. It is growing so fast and has support for nearly every smart home device or platform that provides an api.

*TODO*
I want to add my config here, my devices, special cases about espHome and z-wave.
